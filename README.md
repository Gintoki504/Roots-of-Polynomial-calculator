The program is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to enter a polynomial's coefficients, specify a value for x, and calculate the polynomial's result at that value using Python.

Key Components:
Tkinter: The Python library for creating the graphical interface.
It provides text input fields, buttons, labels, and a window to display the interface.
Numpy: A powerful numerical computing library used to handle polynomial calculations. Specifically, np.poly1d is used to define the polynomial, and poly(x) evaluates it at a given x.
Program Flow:
User Input:

The user enters the polynomial coefficients (comma-separated) and a value for x in text boxes.
Calculate:

When the "Calculate Polynomial at x" button is clicked, the program:
Converts the input coefficients into a polynomial using np.poly1d.
Evaluates the polynomial at the provided x value.
Display Output:

The result (polynomial value at x) is displayed in the window.
Error Handling:

If the user enters invalid input (non-numeric values), an error message pops up.
Example:
For a polynomial like x^2 - 3x + 2 (entered as 1, -3, 2), and x = 2, the program calculates and displays the result P(2) = 0.

How to Run:
Save the script and run it with Python in a terminal or Python IDE.
Make sure Tkinter and Numpy are installed.
This program is a simple tool for performing polynomial evaluations and can be extended for more complex polynomial manipulations if needed.
